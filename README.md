## Introduction
    
The Common Governance Model (CGM) presents an axiomatic framework for understanding how structure emerges through recursive alignment. As an axiomatic model, CGM begins from a single foundational principle and derives all subsequent structure through logical necessity. Each theorem follows inevitably from the axiom, with nothing assumed and everything emerging through recursive self-reference.
    
The model demonstrates that three-dimensional space with six degrees of freedom is not an assumption but a logical derivation. Time appears as the sequential ordering of recursive operations, encoded by gyration's memory of operation order. The mathematical formalism employs gyrogroup and bi-gyrogroup structures following Abraham Ungar's work, providing precise language for tracking transitions from undifferentiated potential to fully structured reality.

## üìä Current Status

### üî¨ Framework Development

**Version 1.0.5:** The Common Governance Model is an experimental framework connecting geometry, cosmology, and biology through recursive principles. Recent work validates theoretical predictions against observational data:

#### üõ∞Ô∏è Observational Validation
- **Planck CMB Analysis:** Testing predictions against microwave background data
- **Distance Duality Test:** Examining cosmic distance relationships using galaxy clusters
- **Supernova Analysis:** Investigating systematic effects in Hubble diagram data

**Implementation Status:** Three independent observational tests have been completed. All results are consistent with CGM predictions‚Äîno contradictions detected, signals remain within observational limits, and expected angular structures appear at sub-detection amplitudes.

*Note: These tests constitute compatibility checks rather than proofs.*

### üî¨ Mathematical Foundation

The framework develops rigorous tools for understanding recursive geometry:
- **Dimensional Calibration:** Unit behavior in gyrogroup structures
- **Geometric Theorems:** Fundamental relationships and proofs
- **Toroidal Holonomy:** Memory patterns in recursive operations
- **Emergent Scaling:** Natural scale generation from first principles

### üîç Discovered Patterns

Key mathematical findings include:
- **Integer Scaling:** Precise relationships between physical scales
- **Geometric Invariants:** Universal quantities across domains
- **Self-Similar Architecture:** Fractal patterns from micro to macro scales
- **Cross-Domain Connections:** Links between cosmic and biological systems
