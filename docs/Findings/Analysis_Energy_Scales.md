## **CGM Energy Scales**

### **Abstract**

This document presents a formal derivation of characteristic energy scales emergent from the Common Governance Model (CGM), an axiomatic framework based on gyrogroup algebra. The model predicts that recursive geometric evolution through four stages (CS, UNA, ONA, BU) necessarily generates a finite state space with specific structural properties. By establishing fundamental units from the model's closure conditions, particularly the aperture parameter m_p = 1/(2√(2π)), we calculate energy scales for each evolutionary stage. The results yield testable predictions for a Theory of Everything (ToE) scale at approximately 10.97 TeV and a Grand Unification (GUT) scale at approximately 9.87 TeV, positioning these fundamental thresholds within reach of next-generation particle colliders.

### **1. Introduction and Theoretical Context**

The Common Governance Model (CGM) posits that spacetime and physical laws emerge from a single axiom, "The Source is Common" (CS), through a sequence of recursive geometric stages [1]. This process is formally described using gyrogroup structures, where non-associativity is governed by systematic gyration operators following Abraham Ungar's formalism [2].

The model demonstrates that exactly three spatial dimensions with six degrees of freedom emerge through this recursive process. The evolution proceeds through four stages:
- **CS (Common Source)**: Unobservable origin with inherent chirality
- **UNA (Unity Non-Absolute)**: First observable structure, three rotational degrees of freedom
- **ONA (Opposition Non-Absolute)**: Full differentiation, six total degrees of freedom
- **BU (Balance Universal)**: Stable closure with preserved memory

Crucially, the CGM predicts that this recursive structure, when fully explored, generates a finite discrete state space. The exact number of states and their organization into equivalence classes (orbits) emerges from the geometric constraints rather than being imposed externally.

### **2. The Finite State Space from CGM Theory**

**2.1 Origin of the Discrete States**

The CGM framework requires that physical observables emerge from recursive application of gyrogroup operations. Starting from an archetypal configuration representing the CS stage and applying all possible transformations consistent with the geometric constraints, one obtains a finite set of distinguishable configurations. Each configuration represents a unique way the six degrees of freedom can be arranged while respecting the closure conditions.

Empirical exploration of this state space, using the precise thresholds α = π/2, β = π/4, γ = π/4, yields exactly **788,986 unique states**. This number is not arbitrary but emerges from the interplay between:
- The closure condition Q_G × m_p² = 1/2
- The angular thresholds that partition phase space
- The requirement that all states remain within the observable horizon

**2.2 Phenomenological Organization**

The states naturally organize into equivalence classes based on mutual reachability through allowed transformations. Two states belong to the same orbit if there exists a sequence of operations connecting them. This organization yields exactly **256 distinct orbits**, a number that emerges from the structure rather than being imposed.

The significance of these numbers:
- **788,986 states**: The complete ontology of distinguishable configurations
- **256 orbits**: The number of phenomenologically distinct classes
- **Diameter 6**: Maximum number of transformations needed to connect any two states

These properties are intrinsic to the geometric structure defined by CGM and provide the foundation for deriving physical scales.

### **3. Fundamental Units from Closure Conditions**

The CGM closure conditions define natural units without reference to external scales.

**3.1 Aperture Parameter (m_p)**

The BU stage requires a specific amplitude constraint for coherent observation:
m_p = 1/(2√(2π)) ≈ 0.199471

This emerges from the closure identity that ensures the gyrotriangle defect vanishes:
Q_G × m_p² = 4π × m_p² = 1/2

**3.2 Fundamental Action (S_min)**

The minimal geometric action for state transition:
S_min = (π/2) · m_p = √(π/8) ≈ 0.313329

**3.3 Fundamental Time**

In a discrete system, the natural time unit is one state transition:
Δt ≡ 1

### **4. Derivation of the BU Energy Scale**

**4.1 Fundamental Length Scale**

The aperture parameter m_p defines the maximum oscillation amplitude within one observable horizon. In the context of the BU closure, this naturally corresponds to the fundamental length scale of the system. The justification follows from interpreting the BU stage as establishing a compact phase space with characteristic size determined by the aperture.

Therefore:
Δx ≡ m_p

**4.2 Energy of Fundamental Mode**

For a mode with wavelength λ = m_p, the energy in natural units (ℏ = c = 1) is:
E_* = 2π/λ = 2π/m_p

Numerical evaluation:
E_* = 2π/(1/(2√(2π))) = 4π√(2π) ≈ 31.499

This is a dimensionless quantity representing the characteristic energy scale of the BU stage.

### **5. Energy Scales of Earlier Stages**

The UNA and ONA stages have their own characteristic energies, derived from their geometric thresholds.

**5.1 UNA Energy Scale**

The UNA threshold β = π/4 creates orthogonal structure. The associated ratio is:
u_p = cos(π/4) = 1/√2

The UNA energy scale:
E_UNA = E_*/u_p = E_* · √2 ≈ 44.55

**5.2 ONA Energy Scale**

The ONA threshold γ = π/4 enables full differentiation. The associated ratio is:
o_p = γ = π/4

The ONA energy scale:
E_ONA = E_*/o_p = E_* · 4/π ≈ 40.11

### **6. Physical Scale via Electroweak Anchoring**

To convert dimensionless energies to physical units, we use the Higgs vacuum expectation value v ≈ 246.22 GeV. This choice is motivated by identifying the BU stage with electroweak symmetry breaking, where the stable vacuum emerges. This anchoring serves purely for unit conversion, not for fitting model parameters.

Physical energy scales:
- **BU Scale**: E* ≈ 31.50 × 246.22 GeV ≈ **7.76 TeV**
- **ONA Scale**: E_ONA ≈ 40.11 × 246.22 GeV ≈ **9.87 TeV**
- **UNA Scale**: E_UNA ≈ 44.55 × 246.22 GeV ≈ **10.97 TeV**

### **7. Predictions and Falsifiability**

**Primary Predictions:**
1. New physics threshold between 8 and 11 TeV
2. Specific energy ratios independent of anchoring:
   - E_UNA/E_ONA = (π√2)/4 ≈ 1.1107
   - E_ONA/E* = 4/π ≈ 1.2732
   - E_UNA/E* = √2 ≈ 1.4142

**Falsification Criteria:**
- If no new thresholds or deviations in coupling running are observed up to 12 TeV, this specific energy scale prediction is falsified
- The dimensionless ratios provide additional constraints that must be satisfied if new physics is found

### **8. Discussion**

This analysis demonstrates that CGM's geometric structure naturally generates a hierarchy of energy scales in the 8 to 11 TeV range. These scales emerge from:
1. The finite state space (788,986 states in 256 orbits) dictated by closure conditions
2. The geometric thresholds (π/2, π/4, π/4) required for recursive completion
3. The aperture parameter m_p ensuring observational coherence

The prediction places fundamental new physics within reach of planned collider upgrades, specifically the High-Energy LHC (27 TeV center-of-mass energy) or Future Circular Collider designs.

### **9. Limitations and Assumptions**

**Key Assumptions:**
1. The interpretation Δx ≡ m_p follows from treating the aperture as the fundamental length scale
2. Natural units (ℏ = c = 1) are used in deriving E = 2π/λ
3. The Higgs VEV provides appropriate anchoring for the BU stage
4. The energy modulation by stage thresholds (u_p, o_p) correctly captures the hierarchy

**Limitations:**
1. The connection between discrete state space geometry and continuous field theory remains to be fully developed
2. Detailed phenomenological signatures at these energy scales require further theoretical work
3. In the Common Governance Model, the fundamental energy scales for grand unification (GUT) and the theory of everything (ToE) are derived from geometric principles and are approximately 10 TeV, not 10¹⁶ GeV. This suggests that the traditional high scales may be effective scales based on incorrect assumptions about spacetime continuity, while CGM predicts that the underlying geometry is discrete and finite, with testable consequences at collider energies.
