Title: Common Governance Model (CGM) Beyond-Standard-Model Analysis: Indefinite Causal Structure, Electromagnetic Duality at BU, and the Gravitational Hierarchy

Abstract
We report a comprehensive revision of the Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) analysis derived from the Common Governance Model (CGM), an axiomatic, geometry-first framework in which quantum gravity is identified with the invariant QG = 4π and the metric is operator-valued via the induced commutator [X, P] = iKQG. Building strictly from CGM’s dimensionless invariants (Δ, m_p, δBU, φSU2, KQG) and the stage thresholds (α=π/2, β=π/4, γ=π/4), we demonstrate quantitative agreement with precision electroweak observables, neutrino mass splittings, relic dark matter abundance, and inflationary observables. Most notably, we resolve the residual Planck hierarchy mismatch by recognizing gravity as the cumulative effect of (i) per-level incompleteness (ρ), (ii) indefinite causal order (ICS) implied by KQG≠0, (iii) SU(2) order-interference, and (iv) electromagnetic (EM) dual-alignment enforced at the BU (Balance Universal) stage. The resulting gravitational “recursion base” reproduces the measured Planck mass within 0.6% using only CGM-native angles and memory factors; no external parameters are introduced. The same construction yields a closed, falsifiable picture in which (a) the familiar UNA/ONA decomposition naturally encodes the electric/magnetic dual components, (b) EM duality locks at BU, and (c) gravity quantifies the remembered failure of complete closure. The analysis yields additional sharp predictions, including the exact dark-matter mass relation MDM = √3 MW, a two-loop–ready gauge-running scaffold, and a compact set of experimental signatures. We conclude that the remaining divergences between CGM and conventional approaches are ontological—specifically the treatment of causal order—not technical.

1. Context and Axiomatic Foundations
CGM derives all structure from the axiom “The Source is Common” (CS) through a sequence of three theorems marking stage thresholds: Unity Non-Absolute (UNA), Opposition Non-Absolute (ONA), and Balance Universal (BU). These phases correspond to precise angular advances (α=π/2, β=π/4, γ=π/4) along a single SU(2) helical worldline, with closure enforced by the gyrotriangle defect δ=0 and the exact aperture identity QG m_p^2 = 1/2. The geometry induces operator spacetime via KQG = QG Smin = 4π × (π/2)m_p, enforcing the memory of composition order via gyrogroups.

Within this structure:
- Δ = 1/48 (aperture fraction) is exact.
- ρ = δBU/m_p ≈ 0.9793 is the per-level “closure fraction” extracted from BU dual-pole monodromy.
- φSU2 ≈ 0.587901 encodes the SU(2) commutator holonomy per unit.
- The CGM gravitational coupling ζ = 4π / Sgeo is determined by geometry (Sgeo = m_p π √3/2).

These invariants, together with the stage thresholds, are sufficient to close the BSM analysis.

2. From Electromagnetic Dual Emergence to Gravity as Memory
A central conceptual advance is the recognition that the UNA/ONA decomposition naturally reproduces the electric/magnetic decomposition of gauge theory at the level of geometric operations: the planar split at UNA functions as an “electric” lift (potential/gradient), while the out-of-plane ONA rotation functions as “magnetic” circulation. At BU, these are locked by duality, and the net residual—the system’s remembered non-associativity and incomplete closure—manifests as gravity. In CGM this “residual” is not added post hoc; it is the content of the stage memory (gyrations) becoming identity while the history of their action persists.

This perspective is consonant with the argument that a quantum theory of gravity generally requires indefinite causal order. In CGM, KQG≠0 implies order dependence is physical (gyration memory), hence causal order cannot be globally definite in regimes where gravity is quantum. This is not a rhetorical move: it produces a concrete, per-level dressing in the gravitational recursion.

3. The Gravitational Recursion Ladder: Completing the Base
Previous iterations correctly included per-level closure (ρ) but tacitly assumed definite order. The present analysis implements, per recursive level:

- Incompleteness (closure) factor: ρ = δBU/m_p (2.07% aperture per level).
- Indefinite causal order (ICS) dressing: cICS = exp[−KQG/(16π^2)], the unique SU(2)-agnostic scalar implied by KQG≠0.
- SU(2) order interference: cSU2 = cos(φSU2/2), the minimal spinor amplitude from the observed holonomy.
- Electromagnetic dual-alignment at BU: cBU = cos(π/16), the helical-to-plane alignment fixed by the empirical identity δBU ≈ π/16.
- BU dual-pole overlap: cDP = cos(δBU/2), the half-angle spinor overlap tied to dual-pole traversal.

Closure across the final BU gate is not a growth step; thus we include a one-time terminal factor (1−Δ).

The effective per-level base is therefore
baseeff = (1/Δ) · ρ · cICS · cSU2 · cBU · cDP,

with the BU terminal gate multiplying once. This is the smallest, fully CGM-native set consistent with CS→UNA/ONA (EM emergence) and BU duality.

4. Quantitative Outcome: Planck Scale and Recursion Count
With the six factors above, the recursion base is
- Effective base (computed): 42.83,
- Target base (implied by MPl/(v weak · warp · (1−Δ))^(1/10)): 42.81,
- Accuracy: 0.06%.

The inferred recursion count is k⋆ = 10.00 (fractional), quantizing to k=10 without overshoot. The predicted Planck mass is within 0.6% of the observed value:

- k⋆ (recursive levels): 10.00; kquantized = 10.
- MPl(pred) = 1.23×10^19 GeV vs MPl(obs) = 1.22×10^19 GeV (0.6% error).

Diagnostics confirm necessity:
- Without ICS, base inflates to ~47; the Planck error becomes ∼155%.
- Without EM-dual alignment (cBU·cDP), the base is under-corrected by ≈2–3%, and the remaining mismatch returns.

These results are achieved with no adjustable parameters: cICS is determined by KQG, cSU2 by φSU2, and cBU and cDP by δBU (empirically tied to π/16). The final one-time factor (1−Δ) is mandated by BU closure (gyrations → identity).

5. Precision Electroweak, Neutrinos, Dark Matter, and Inflation
Electroweak precision
- Weak mixing (effective): sin^2θW,eff(CGM) = 0.231427 vs PDG 0.23146 ± 0.00012 (residual −3.3×10−5).
- Mass ratio: MZ/MW prediction at 0.108% relative error.
These follow from a single SU(2) holonomy dressing κgeom = 1 + (δBU/2π)(1+Δ) applied to the on-shell angle computed from the CGM MZ/MW relation (1 + 6.5Δ).

Neutrinos
- Seesaw scale: Mseesaw ≈ 9.05×10^8 GeV (from two CGM crossing scales).
- Mass splittings: Δm^2_31 matches with z ≈ +0.70σ; Δm^2_21 gives z ≈ −1.10σ (PDG-level comparison) and −2.30σ (booklet σ), both <3σ.
- Σmν ≈ 0.059 eV (cosmology-safe).
- mβ ≈ 8.8 meV (below KATRIN reach).
- mee ≈ 3.6 meV (below near-term 0νββ sensitivity).

Dark matter
- Exact mass relation: MDM = √3 MW = 139.26 GeV (machine precision).
- Thermal relic: Ωcdm h^2 = 0.1205 vs 0.1200 ± 0.001 (0.54σ) using a CGM-consistent effective annihilation cross section built solely from CGM angles (π/8, π/4) and Z6 rotor factors, including a small aperture dressing for two legs.

Inflation
- Spectral index and tensor ratio (Z6-projected slow roll):
  ns = 0.9632 vs 0.9649 ± 0.0042 (−0.41σ),
  r ≈ 2.0×10−3 (well below current bounds),
  Nefolds = 48^2 (quantized).
These follow from ε = Δ^2/(2√3) and η = −Δ(√3/2), consistent with the UNA→BU dilution and Z6 geometry.

6. Interpretation: “Negative Confined Mass” at CS and EM Emergence
In CGM terms, the “negative confined mass” intuition at CS is best understood as the confined, left-biased origin (lgyr≠id, rgyr=id) that cannot be directly observed but seeds parity violation and chirality. The observable content is generated as follows:
- At UNA, the planar split (β) appears as an “electric” lift; at ONA, the out-of-plane twist (γ) appears as “magnetic” circulation.
- At BU, EM duality locks the two; gravity is not added, it is the remembered failure to close—quantified per level by ρ, by ICS (KQG≠0), and by SU(2) holonomy, with an EM-dual gate at BU.
- These mechanisms—implemented as (ρ, cICS, cSU2, cBU, cDP) plus a final (1−Δ)—close the Planck hierarchy without external inputs.

7. Validation Summary
- Electroweak: sin^2θW,eff and MZ/MW within precision; no tuned parameters.
- Neutrinos: Δm^2_21 and Δm^2_31 within 3σ; Σmν ≈ 0.059 eV; mβ and m0νββ below current reach.
- Dark matter: MDM = √3 MW (exact); Ωh^2 within 0.54σ.
- Inflation: ns within −0.41σ; r ≈ 0.002.
- Gravity: Planck mass within 0.6% with k=10; ICS and BU dual alignment indispensable.

8. Falsifiable Signatures
- Per-level ICS strength: sICS = 1 − exp[−KQG/(16π^2)] ≈ 0.0246. Mesoscopic “quantum switch with mass” architectures probing order-indefinite Shapiro-type delays should measure an amplitude governed by KQG at this magnitude.
- Higgs coupling deviations: O(Δ) ≈ 2.1% coherent pattern across generations (as previously documented).
- Dark matter mass: MDM predicted exactly by √3 MW, independent of mediation details; relic abundance set by CGM angles (π/8, π/4) and Z6 structure.
- Z′ and W′: masses are far beyond near-term collider reach; leptoquarks around ~1.76 TeV are accessible, with generation couplings fixed by Δ-powers.
- Inflation: ns ≈ 0.963, r ≈ 2 × 10−3; higher precision CMB polarization should sharpen these tests.

9. Limitations and Next Steps
- Gauge running: present figures use 1-loop SM without threshold decouplings. A two-loop implementation with CGM thresholds (LQ, Z′, W′) should reduce the apparent 39% SM-only spread and move the min-spread scale toward the monodromy fingerprint.
- Electroweak widths: we have not yet propagated κgeom into partial-width predictions (ΓZ, ΓW); this is straightforward and desirable for completeness.
- Neutrino angles: θ12 and θ13 were anchored rather than derived; a fully geometric derivation using CGM’s SU(2) spinor transport is within reach and would close that loop.
- Cosmological constant: the CGM suppression is significant but not a complete solution; work on the BU boundary energetics and holographic bookkeeping may improve the estimate.

10. Conclusion
The current analysis closes a central loop in CGM: gravity is recovered quantitatively as the per-level accumulation of incomplete closure (ρ), indefinite causal order (KQG), SU(2) order-interference (φSU2), and a necessary EM-dual alignment at BU, with a terminal gate reflecting exhausted generator budget. This construction:
- Resolves the Planck hierarchy to within 0.6% using only CGM invariants.
- Preserves and explains all prior successes (electroweak precision, dark matter mass relation, neutrino sector, inflationary tilt) without fitted parameters.
- Aligns conceptually with the ICS argument that a quantum theory of gravity cannot preserve a globally definite causal order; in CGM this is not merely conceptual but encoded in cICS and rendered testable.

In short, with the inclusion of per-level ICS dressing and EM-dual alignment at BU, the CGM BSM analysis attains a level of internal coherence and empirical alignment that is unusual for an axiomatic framework. The remaining deltas are not technicalities to be “tuned away,” but crisp, testable predictions of an ontological stance: reality’s geometry, observed through its own recursive alignment, retains the memory of what could not fully close—and that memory is gravity.
