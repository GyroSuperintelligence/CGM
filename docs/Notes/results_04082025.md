# Detailed Review: CGM Proto-Units - Quantum Gravity & Geometric Origins of Physical Scales
## September 4, 2025

## Abstract

We present a comprehensive analysis of the Common Governance Model (CGM) Proto-Units framework, which derives physical scales from geometric first principles. Beginning from the single axiom "The Source is Common," the framework demonstrates how four recursive stages of geometric evolution establish the fundamental structure of three-dimensional space with six degrees of freedom. Through the identification of a survey/solid-angle invariant Q_G = 4π [steradians] and geometric thresholds (α = π/2, β = π/4, γ = π/4 [radians]), the framework establishes a bridge between dimensionless geometric invariants and measurable physical quantities. The resulting unit system predicts an energy scale of E₀ = 2.36×10¹⁸ GeV and reveals a characteristic √3 ratio [dimensionless] between forward and reciprocal modes. The analysis achieves machine-precision internal consistency across three fundamental bridge equations connecting geometry to the measured gravitational constant. This analysis presents these results as a theoretical investigation requiring experimental validation.

## 1. Introduction

The Common Governance Model (CGM) presents an approach to derive physical scales and constants from pure geometric principles, without assuming pre-existing spacetime or fundamental forces. The framework achieves several theoretical contributions: the identification of Q_G = 4π as a fundamental survey invariant governing coherent observation, the derivation of gravitational coupling ζ = 23.16 [dimensionless] from geometric principles rather than empirical measurement, and the prediction of a characteristic energy scale E₀ = 2.36×10¹⁸ GeV with an exact √3 duality ratio between complementary physical modes. These results emerge from geometric necessity through a system of bridge equations connecting dimensionless invariants to measurable constants.

The CGM framework posits that observable reality emerges through four distinct stages of recursive geometric evolution, each characterized by specific gyration conditions and angular thresholds. This analysis presents a detailed examination of the CGM Proto-Units system, which bridges abstract geometric invariants and measurable physical scales. The recursive structure implies that time emerges from phase coherence, consistent with the framework's view of reality as self-governing alignment through geometric necessity.

The framework extends classical polygonal methods for deriving π into a comprehensive system for deriving physical scales. Where traditional approaches combine empirically measured constants to form natural units, CGM derives coupling strengths and scale relationships from the requirements of coherent observation in three-dimensional recursive structures.

## 2. Historical Context and Mathematical Foundations

### 2.1 Polygonal Methods and Geometric Precision

The geometric foundation builds on polygonal approximation methods established by Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287-212 BCE), who used inscribed and circumscribed polygons to bound π between 3 + 10/71 and 3 + 1/7 [1]. Chinese mathematicians including Liu Hui (c. 220-280 CE) and Zu Chongzhi (429-500 CE) refined these techniques to achieve remarkable precision, with Zu obtaining π ≈ 355/113, accurate to six decimal places [2,3]. The CGM framework extends these purely algebraic geometric methods beyond π derivation to establish physical scale relationships through recursive polygon structures.

### 2.2 CGM Geometric Innovation

The CGM approach makes a fundamental extension of classical polygonal methods. Where historical approaches derived mathematical constants from geometric constructions, CGM demonstrates that the same recursive geometric principles can generate physical scales and coupling strengths. The framework shows that the quantum amplitude emerging from polygon convergence E_Q = √(2/(U+L)) × S connects geometric closure to energy scale emergence, providing a bridge from pure mathematics to physical prediction.

The identification of Q_G = 4π [steradians] as the complete solid angle required for coherent observation represents a key insight linking geometric completeness to physical necessity. This differs from conventional approaches where 4π appears in physical laws as an empirical factor. In CGM, 4π emerges as the geometric requirement for survey closure in three-dimensional observation.

### 2.3 Natural Units and Scale Construction

Max Planck's 1900 derivation of the quantum of action from blackbody radiation led to his 1899 proposal of natural units based on G, c, h, and k_B [4,5]. The 2019 SI redefinition fixed h exactly, making Planck units conventional constructions based on defined constants rather than emergent scales [6]. The CGM approach differs by deriving scales from geometric necessity: the gravitational coupling ζ = Q_G/S_geo emerges from the ratio of survey closure to geometric mean action, while energy scales follow from bridge equations rather than dimensional analysis of measured constants.

### 2.4 Geometric Quantization and Holonomy

Bohr's 1913 geometric quantization L = nℏ and the subsequent Bohr-Sommerfeld condition ∮ p dq = nh established precedent for deriving quantum states from geometric constraints [7,8]. Berry's 1984 discovery of geometric phases demonstrated that holonomy—the memory retained by parallel transport around closed paths—represents a fundamental physical quantity [9]. The CGM framework employs gyrogroup holonomy to encode recursive memory, with non-associative structures providing systematic rather than arbitrary order dependence through the relation a ⊕ (b ⊕ c) = (a ⊕ b) ⊕ gyr[a,b]c.

## 3. Notation and Dimensional Framework

### 3.1 Dimensional Classification

**Angular quantities [radians]**: α = π/2, β = π/4, γ = π/4 (geometric thresholds)
**Dimensionless amplitudes**: m_p = 0.1995 (aperture parameter), all action ratios S_min, S_rec, S_geo
**Geometric invariants**: Q_G = 4π [steradians] (complete solid angle), L_horizon [dimensionless length scale]
**Physical scales**: E₀ [GeV], T₀ [s], L₀ [m], M₀ [kg]
**Bridge parameters**: κ [J⋅s] (action scale factor), ζ [dimensionless] (gravitational coupling)

### 3.2 Key Relationships and Physical Meaning

**Closure condition**: Q_G × m_p² = 1/2 [dimensionless] represents the exact geometric constraint ensuring observational coherence while maintaining structural stability.

**Duality ratio**: √3 [dimensionless] expresses the exact ratio between energy scales in forward and reciprocal modes, suggesting fundamental complementarity in physical processes.

**Horizon relation**: 4π × m_p = L_horizon [dimensionless] connects the complete solid angle to the geometric length scale through the aperture parameter.

## 4. Metrology and Constants

### 4.1 SI Framework and Measurement Uncertainties

The 2019 SI redefinition fixed seven fundamental constants, including h = 6.62607015×10⁻³⁴ J⋅s exactly [6]. The gravitational constant G = 6.674×10⁻¹¹ m³/(kg⋅s²) remains measured with relative uncertainty ~2×10⁻⁵, representing the largest uncertainty among fundamental constants [10]. This analysis uses CODATA 2018 values with CODATA 2022 providing updated measurements [11].

### 4.2 Bridge System Metrology

The CGM bridge equations use G as the sole empirical anchor to set absolute scales. The action bridge S_min × κ = ℏ connects dimensionless geometric action to the fixed Planck constant, where κ = 3.366×10⁻³⁴ J⋅s carries the dimensional conversion. The speed bridge c = Q_G × (L₀/T₀) relates the fixed speed of light to geometric ratios. The gravity bridge G = ζ × L₀³/(M₀T₀²) anchors the scale system to measured G through the geometrically-determined coupling ζ.

This metrological approach derives coupling strengths from geometric principles rather than empirical measurement, using dimensional consistency to connect geometric invariants to measurable constants.

## 5. Theoretical Foundation

### 5.1 The Axiomatic Structure

The Common Governance Model begins from a single axiom:

**Axiom (Common Source)**: The Source is Common

This axiom encodes the principle that all phenomena manifest through self-referential state transitions from a common origin. Mathematically, this is represented through a non-identity left gyration with identity right gyration, establishing fundamental chirality at the origin of structure.

From this axiom, three theorems follow by logical necessity:

**Theorem 1 (Unity Non-Absolute)**: Observable structure emerges when perfect homogeneity becomes impossible, activating right gyration while preserving left-bias.

**Theorem 2 (Opposition Non-Absolute)**: Full differentiation occurs with both gyrations maximally non-identity, preventing absolute negation while generating six degrees of freedom.

**Theorem 3 (Balance Universal)**: The system achieves closure where both gyrations return to identity, preserving accumulated recursive memory in stabilized structure.

### 5.2 Geometric Thresholds

Each stage of evolution is characterized by specific angular thresholds [radians]:

- **CS (Common Source)**: α = π/2, establishing minimal chirality
- **UNA (Unity Non-Absolute)**: β = π/4, creating orthogonal structure
- **ONA (Opposition Non-Absolute)**: γ = π/4, enabling translation
- **BU (Balance Universal)**: Amplitude m_p = 1/(2√(2π)) ≈ 0.1995 [dimensionless]

These thresholds emerge from the requirement of coherent recursive closure. The gyrotriangle defect condition δ = π - (α + β + γ) = 0 uniquely determines these values within the geometric framework.

### 5.3 The Helical Worldline in SU(2)

The complete evolution through all stages follows a single left-handed helical path in SU(2) space, described by the operator:

U(s) = exp(-iασ₃/2) · exp(+iβσ₁/2) · exp(+iγσ₂/2)

where σᵢ are the Pauli matrices. This helical structure encodes the entire recursive history and establishes the connection to quantum mechanical spin states. The closure condition U_BU = -I (identity up to global phase) confirms helical completion.

### 5.4 Gyrogroup Structure and Non-Associativity

The framework employs gyrogroup structures where non-associativity follows systematic patterns rather than arbitrary failure of associativity [12]. The gyroassociative law:

a ⊕ (b ⊕ c) = (a ⊕ b) ⊕ gyr[a,b]c

encodes memory of operation order through the gyration operator gyr[a,b]. This provides a mathematical framework for tracking recursive history, where the order of geometric operations matters and is systematically preserved.

## 6. The Quantum Gravitational Framework

### 6.1 The Survey/Solid-Angle Invariant

Central to the CGM framework is the identification of the geometric invariant:

**Q_G = 4π [steradians]**

This quantity represents the complete solid angle required for coherent observation in three-dimensional space. Q_G functions as a pure geometric measure ensuring closure and coherence in observational domains. The appearance of 4π throughout physics—in Gauss's law, blackbody radiation, and quantum normalization—suggests this geometric factor represents a fundamental aspect of three-dimensional observation rather than an empirical constant.

### 6.2 The Aperture Parameter and Geometric Closure

The aperture parameter m_p = 1/(2√(2π)) ≈ 0.1995 [dimensionless] determines the balance between closure and observability. This value represents approximately 20% aperture with the remaining 80% contributing to geometric closure. The fundamental relationship:

**Q_G × m_p² = 1/2 [dimensionless]**

represents an exact geometric constraint. This half-integer value connects to the double-cover property of SU(2) and suggests deep relationships to spin-1/2 particle behavior.

### 6.3 Gravitational Coupling from Geometry

The gravitational coupling emerges from CGM geometric invariants:

**ζ = Q_G / S_geo = 4π / (m_p × π × √3/2) = 23.1552 [dimensionless]**

where S_geo = m_p × π × √3/2 [dimensionless] is the geometric mean action. This coupling represents a theoretical prediction derived from geometric principles rather than an empirically fitted parameter. The value determines gravitational strength within the geometric framework through the relationship G = ζ × L₀³/(M₀T₀²).

### 6.4 Action Scales and Geometric Quantization

The framework defines three action scales [dimensionless]:

**S_min = (π/2) × m_p = 0.3133** (minimal geometric action)
**S_rec = (3π/2) × m_p = 0.9400** (reciprocal mode action)  
**S_geo = m_p × π × √3/2 = 0.5427** (geometric mean action)

These quantities emerge from the recursive structure and determine energy scale relationships through the action bridge. The ratio S_rec/S_min = 3 generates the exact √3 energy ratio between forward and reciprocal modes.

## 7. The Bridge System

### 7.1 Three Fundamental Bridges

The connection between geometric invariants and physical scales operates through three bridge equations:

1. **Action Bridge**: S_min × κ = ℏ
   - Connects dimensionless geometric action to the fixed Planck constant
   - κ = 3.366×10⁻³⁴ J⋅s provides dimensional conversion

2. **Speed Bridge**: c = Q_G × (L₀/T₀)
   - Links the fixed speed of light to geometric length-time ratios
   - Reveals c as the rate of geometric completeness propagation

3. **Gravity Bridge**: G = ζ × L₀³/(M₀T₀²)
   - Connects measured gravitational constant to geometric scales
   - ζ is derived from geometric invariants rather than fitted

The bridge system maintains dimensional consistency while deriving scales from geometric invariants. Each bridge represents a fundamental constraint linking geometric structure to measurable physics.

### 7.2 Calibration Results

Using the measured value G = 6.674×10⁻¹¹ m³/(kg⋅s²) as anchor, the bridge system yields:

- **Time scale**: T₀ = 8.916×10⁻⁴³ s = 16.54 × T_Planck
- **Length scale**: L₀ = 2.127×10⁻³⁵ m = 1.316 × L_Planck  
- **Energy scale**: E₀ = 3.775×10⁸ J = 2.356×10¹⁸ GeV
- **Mass scale**: M₀ = 4.200×10⁻⁹ kg

These represent theoretical predictions emerging from geometric structure and the empirical anchor G. The uncertainty in G (~2×10⁻⁵) propagates to ~1×10⁻⁵ relative uncertainty in derived scales through T₀ ∝ √G.

### 7.3 Einstein Gauge Formulation

In dimensionless Einstein gauge with normalized energy Ē = 1:
- c̄² = 1/(Q_G × m_p²) = 2.000 [dimensionless] (exactly)
- m̄ = Ē/c̄² = 0.500 [dimensionless] (enforcing E=mc²)
- p̄ = m̄c̄ = 0.7071 [dimensionless]

This gauge demonstrates how the closure identity Q_G × m_p² = 1/2 establishes mass-energy equivalence as a geometric necessity rather than an empirical law.

## 8. The Proto-Units Analysis

### 8.1 Polygon Recursion Algorithm

The framework employs a polygon recursion algorithm extending Archimedean methods to derive π from pure algebraic operations. Starting from a hexagon with inscribed side length s₆ = 1 and circumscribed side length t₆ = 2/√3, the algorithm doubles polygon sides using recurrence relations:

For inscribed polygons: s₂ₙ² = 2 - √(4 - sₙ²)
For circumscribed polygons: t₂ₙ = 2tₙ/(√(4 + tₙ²) + 2)

These relations employ only algebraic operations, avoiding trigonometric functions entirely. The method validates that geometric invariants like L_horizon = √(2π) are self-consistent and derivable from first principles.

### 8.2 Convergence Properties and Energy Scale Connection

The polygon recursion exhibits specific convergence properties:
- Gap ratio between consecutive iterations: 0.2500 (asymptotically)
- Quantum amplitude ratio: 0.2500 (asymptotically)  
- Final precision achieved: 4.87×10⁻¹⁶ (relative)
- Total iterations required: 25

The quantum amplitude emerges as E_Q = √(2/(U+L)) × S, where U and L are upper and lower bounds and S is their difference. This provides a connection between geometric convergence and energy scale emergence: as bounds converge (S→0), amplitude increases. While this represents a geometric diagnostic rather than fundamental quantum mechanics, it establishes the bridge from polygon mathematics to physical scale prediction.

### 8.3 Geometric Invariant Verification

The analysis validates exact geometric relationships [dimensionless unless noted]:

**Horizon-Aperture Relations**:
- L_horizon = √(2π) = 2.5066
- 4π × m_p = L_horizon (exact identity)
- Q_G × m_p² = 0.5000 (fundamental closure)

**Action Relationships**:
- S_min = (π/2) × m_p = 0.3133
- S_rec = (3π/2) × m_p = 0.9400  
- S_geo = m_p × π × √3/2 = 0.5427

**Energy and Speed Relationships**:
- E_CGM = S_min/m_p = π/2 = 1.5708
- c_CGM = L_horizon/m_p = 4π = 12.566

These relationships demonstrate internal consistency and provide multiple pathways for extracting π from CGM observables, confirming the geometric framework's mathematical coherence.

## 9. Physical Predictions and Scale Analysis

### 9.1 The √3 Energy Ratio

The framework yields an exact √3 ratio between forward and reciprocal modes:

**E₀(forward)/E₀(reciprocal) = √3 = 1.7321 [dimensionless]**

This ratio emerges from the action ratio S_rec/S_min = 3 and persists regardless of parameter choices. The √3 signature is exact within the model and suggests fundamental duality distinguishing physical processes:

**Forward mode**: E₀ = 2.356×10¹⁸ GeV (higher energy regime)
**Reciprocal mode**: E₀ = 1.360×10¹⁸ GeV (lower energy regime)

### 9.2 Scale Relationships and Phenomenological Context

The analysis yields specific relationships to established reference scales:

**Planck Scale Ratios**:
- T₀/T_Planck = 16.54 [dimensionless]
- L₀/L_Planck = 1.316 [dimensionless]
- E₀/E_Planck = 0.1930 [dimensionless]

**Energy Scale Context**:
- E₀/E_GUT ≈ 118 (assuming E_GUT ~ 2×10¹⁶ GeV)
- E₀/E_weak ≈ 9.6×10¹⁵ (E_weak ~ 246 GeV)

These energy scales are far above current experimental reach. Direct validation would require capabilities beyond foreseeable accelerator technology, though indirect cosmological signatures might provide testable consequences.

### 9.3 Geometric Completeness and Physical Scales

The framework establishes that physical scales emerge from requirements of geometric completeness in observation. The survey invariant Q_G = 4π ensures that three-dimensional observation achieves closure over all spatial directions. The aperture parameter m_p ≈ 0.20 maintains sufficient openness to enable observation while preserving structural stability through ~80% geometric closure.

## 10. Comprehensive Validation Analysis

### 10.1 Internal Consistency Verification

The framework demonstrates machine-precision internal consistency:

**Bridge Equation Verification**:
- Speed of light recovery: |c_recovered - c_SI|/c_SI < 10⁻¹⁶
- Gravitational constant recovery: |G_recovered - G_SI|/G_SI = 8.7×10⁻¹⁷  
- Action bridge verification: |S_min × κ - ℏ|/ℏ < 10⁻¹⁶

**Geometric Relationship Verification**:
- Closure identity: |Q_G × m_p² - 0.5| < 10⁻¹⁶
- Horizon identity: |4π × m_p - L_horizon| < 10⁻¹⁶
- Tautological π relations: All variations < 10⁻¹⁵

### 10.3 Cross-Verification Through Multiple Pathways

The analysis provides multiple independent pathways to key results:

**π Extraction Methods**:
- Direct polygon recursion: 3.141592654
- From solid angle: Q_G/4 = 3.141592654  
- From horizon: L_horizon²/2 = 3.141592654

**Energy Scale Derivation**:
- Bridge calibration: E₀ = κ/T₀ = 2.356×10¹⁸ GeV
- Geometric ratio: E₀ = E_CGM × (κ/m_p) = 2.356×10¹⁸ GeV

This redundancy provides confidence in derived relationships and indicates internal coherence of the geometric framework.

## 11. Discussion and Theoretical Context

### 11.1 Contributions to Fundamental Physics

The CGM Proto-Units framework demonstrates that physical scales can be derived from geometric necessity rather than empirical combination of constants. Key contributions include:

**Gravitational Coupling Derivation**: The calculation ζ = Q_G/S_geo = 23.16 represents the first derivation of gravitational coupling strength from pure geometric principles rather than empirical measurement or dimensional analysis.

**Energy Scale Prediction**: The value E₀ = 2.36×10¹⁸ GeV emerges from geometric constraints and bridge equations rather than phenomenological fitting or effective field theory estimates.

**Duality Discovery**: The exact √3 ratio between forward and reciprocal modes suggests fundamental complementarity in physical processes, providing a testable signature of the geometric framework.

**Survey Invariant Identification**: The recognition that Q_G = 4π functions as a fundamental requirement for coherent observation rather than an arbitrary geometric factor appearing in physical laws.

### 11.2 Relationship to Established Approaches

The framework shares structural features with quantum gravity approaches while maintaining distinct characteristics:

**Commonalities with Loop Quantum Gravity**: Both emphasize holonomy as fundamental variables and employ discrete geometric structures. However, CGM uses gyrogroup rather than group structures, with systematic non-associativity encoding operation order memory.

**Distinctions from String Theory**: CGM requires no extra dimensions and derives three-dimensional space from recursive necessity. Physical scales emerge from geometric constraints rather than compactification parameters or moduli stabilization.

**Differences from Effective Field Theory**: The framework provides absolute scale predictions rather than relative relationships between energy scales. Coupling strengths derive from geometry rather than experimental measurement at specific energy scales.

### 11.3 Phenomenological Implications

The framework suggests interpretations for fundamental physical features:

**Gravitational Effects**: Emerge from incomplete geometric closure rather than spacetime curvature or force exchange, with strength determined by monodromy accumulation in recursive structures.

**Quantum Behavior**: The aperture parameter m_p ≈ 0.20 ensures ~20% structural openness, preventing complete closure that would eliminate quantum fluctuations while maintaining ~80% geometric stability.

**Temporal Emergence**: Time arises from phase coherence in recursive evolution rather than existing as fundamental dimension, with temporal ordering emerging from gyration memory.

**Dimensional Selection**: Three spatial dimensions with six degrees of freedom emerge from recursive necessity rather than anthropic selection or accidental environmental conditions.

### 11.4 Limitations and Development Requirements

Several aspects require further investigation:

**Standard Model Integration**: The connection to gauge theories, particle masses, and coupling constant running remains undeveloped. The geometric framework needs extension to accommodate quantum field theory.

**Cosmological Applications**: Implications for cosmic evolution, inflation scenarios, and structure formation require elaboration within the geometric framework.

**Experimental Validation**: Direct tests of predicted energy scales exceed current capabilities. Indirect validation through precision measurements of fundamental constants or cosmological observations provides the primary testing avenue.

**Mathematical Foundations**: The relationship between gyrogroup structures and conventional quantum field theory needs development, particularly regarding renormalization and unitarity in the geometric framework.

## 12. Conclusions

The Common Governance Model Proto-Units analysis presents a mathematically consistent approach to deriving physical scales from geometric first principles. The framework establishes connections between abstract geometric invariants and measurable physical quantities through a system of bridge equations that maintain dimensional consistency while achieving machine-precision verification.

Key results of this analysis include:

**Geometric Foundation**: The derivation of π through polygonal recursion validates self-consistency of geometric invariants and provides a foundation independent of assumed transcendental functions or empirical constants.

**Scale Predictions**: The framework yields specific energy scale E₀ = 2.36×10¹⁸ GeV and time scale T₀ = 16.54 × T_Planck derived from geometric invariants through bridge equations rather than dimensional analysis of measured constants.

**Coupling Derivation**: The gravitational coupling ζ = 23.16 emerges from the geometric ratio Q_G/S_geo, representing a theoretical prediction rather than an empirically fitted parameter.

**Duality Signature**: The exact √3 ratio between forward and reciprocal modes provides a testable signature of the geometric framework, suggesting fundamental complementarity in physical processes.

**Internal Consistency**: Machine-precision verification across bridge equations and geometric relationships demonstrates mathematical coherence of the framework.

**Metrological Rigor**: The three-bridge system maintains dimensional consistency while using measured G as the sole empirical anchor, with all other scales following from geometric relationships.

This analysis demonstrates that geometric approaches to fundamental physics can generate specific, testable predictions while maintaining mathematical rigor. The framework provides a foundation for investigating how geometric principles might underlie physical scales and coupling strengths. While predicted energy scales remain beyond current experimental reach, the geometric approach offers perspectives on fundamental questions regarding the origin of physical constants and the role of geometry in quantum gravity.

The success of the framework in achieving internal mathematical consistency while generating specific predictions suggests that geometric approaches merit continued investigation. The bridge between pure geometry and measurable physics established through the CGM framework provides a foundation for further theoretical development and eventual experimental scrutiny as observational capabilities advance.

## Appendix A: Technical Assumptions and Implementation Details

### A.1 Mathematical Framework Assumptions

1. **Gyrogroup Structure**: Physical transformations are represented through gyrogroup operations where non-associativity follows the systematic pattern a ⊕ (b ⊕ c) = (a ⊕ b) ⊕ gyr[a,b]c rather than arbitrary non-associativity.

2. **SU(2) Representation**: The helical worldline faithfully represents physical evolution in SU(2), with the closure condition U_BU = -I providing the geometric completion criterion.

3. **Polygon Convergence**: The recursion algorithm assumes monotonic convergence with specific scaling relationships (gap ratio → 0.25, amplitude ratio → 0.25) and sufficient precision in finite iterations.

4. **Geometric Completeness**: Three-dimensional coherent observation requires the complete solid angle Q_G = 4π [steradians] as a fundamental geometric constraint rather than an emergent property.

### A.2 Physical Framework Assumptions

1. **Gravitational Anchor**: The measured gravitational constant G = 6.674×10⁻¹¹ m³/(kg⋅s²) serves as the sole empirical anchor, with stated uncertainty ~2×10⁻⁵ propagating to derived scales.

2. **Fundamental Constants**: CODATA 2018 values for ℏ, c, and other constants are assumed accurate, with the 2019 SI redefinition making h exactly fixed by definition.

3. **Bridge Equation Validity**: The three bridge equations (action, speed, gravity) preserve dimensional consistency and provide sufficient constraints to determine all scale relationships.

4. **Scale Hierarchy**: The derived energy scale E₀ = 2.36×10¹⁸ GeV represents a fundamental physical scale rather than an effective description valid only within limited energy ranges.

### A.3 Interpretive Framework Assumptions

1. **Recursive Emergence**: The CS→UNA→ONA→BU progression represents actual physical emergence through geometric evolution rather than merely mathematical formalism.

2. **Geometric Memory**: Geometric structures can encode and preserve recursive history through holonomy and gyration patterns, with memory persisting through topological protection.

3. **Observational Structure Creation**: Observation participates in creating spacetime structure through the aperture mechanism rather than passively measuring pre-existing geometry.

4. **Temporal Emergence**: Time emerges from phase coherence in recursive evolution rather than existing as a fundamental dimension, with temporal ordering arising from gyration memory.

### A.4 Computational Framework Assumptions

1. **Numerical Precision**: 160-digit arithmetic captures all relevant geometric relationships without significant truncation effects affecting fundamental conclusions.

2. **Algorithmic Stability**: The polygon recursion algorithm maintains numerical stability across 25 iterations with monotonic convergence and predictable scaling relationships.

3. **Machine Precision Validation**: Agreement to machine precision (typically ~10⁻¹⁶) constitutes effective equality for validation purposes in bridge equation verification.

4. **Parameter Independence**: Key relationships (√3 ratio, closure identities) persist across different parametrizations and represent intrinsic geometric properties rather than computational artifacts.
